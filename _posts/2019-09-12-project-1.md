The Swinburne Mechatronics Engineering Society's first Kahoot Night! 

Bringing back the memories of first year with some Kahoots, FREE pizza and prizes! Entry is FREE, so bring your mates over to the Hammer & Swine! Don't worry, this isn't a mid-sem test so questions will be pretty chill - green calc can't help you here! Even if you're not doing mechatronics, you'll still have a great time... and did we mention FREE PIZZA!?
